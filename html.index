  <h1>SQL CHALLENGE</h1>
  
  <p>
  This was a sql based data analysis assignment. We had to combine and 
  import different data sets to effectively search for and select the necessary information.<br>
  
  We started off by creating a layout of our tables and then exporting the code to help us import the data we needed.<br>
